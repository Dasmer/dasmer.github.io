# Power: Why Some People Have It—and Others Don't
By Jeffery Pfeffer

## Notes


### Introduction

#### Anecdotes
**Anne Anecdote** Anne made herself scarce (taking classes in engineering school where there's one MBA for every 4 engineers). She showed patience by suggesting a different target market but not forcing it. When the team failed, they saw her value. She did this with presentations and financial projections as well. She had the group appreciate her and realize that she could make a credible threat to quit by letting the group know about her consulting offer. When looking for a CEO, Anne introduced the group to other MBAs, knowing that they're probably most comfortable with her given all the rapport she had built with them. She eventually became co-CEO.
**Beth Anecdote** Beth had a less favorable post-MBA trajectory. She thought the world was fair and she was unwilling to play organizational politics (self-handicapping)

Empirical Research confirms that being politically savvy and seeking power are related to career success and managerial performance.

#### Why you should want Power
- Having power and a feeling of control (and thus not feeling stress or out of control) prolongs life expectancy
- Having power increases wealth (Clintons post White House / Rudy after being Mayor both made a ton from speaking and connections)
- Power is necessary to get things done

There are three major obstacles in figuring out a path to power and use what you learn

#### Stop thinking the world is a just place
We assume that people that are doing inappropriate, self-aggrandizing, 'pushing the envelope', even if they are successful they will eventually fall.
This has negative effect on the ability to acquire power
- Hinders people's ability to learn from all situation and all people, even those they don't like or respect.
- It makes people not proactive in building a power base

'Just-world hypothesis' comes from people wanting to think the world was predictable and comprehensible → thus controllable. It also holds that people that are fortunate are treated as if they must have done good to earn it. Similarly, if someone is not fortunate, people presume they did something bad.

#### Beware of Leadership Literature
Successful leaders gloss over their power plays.
To be successful, people create a positive image of themselves. This makes it seem as if we're in a just world, although it is not reality.
A study shows there were substantial misstatements on more than 40% of resumes.
Follow social science and your own experience. Not Leadership Literature.

#### Get out of your own way
**Self-Handicapping** People desire to feel good about themselves and their ability. Failure puts our self-esteem at risk. So if we intentionally choose to do things that might diminish our performance, any subsequent poor results can be explained away as not reflecting our innate abilities.
ie: I didn't get it because I didn't try.
People do this with being political. I didn't rise to the top because I didn't try.

#### A guide to using this book

1. Try what you learn
1. Model behavior of effective people you read about.


### Chapter 1: It Takes More Than Performance
As long as you keep your boss happy, performance does not matter that much. If you upset them, performance won't save you.

#### The weak link between performance and job outcomes
Supervisors that choose their subordinates rate them more highly than subordinates they inherited.
Confirmation Bias: Chose > Inherited > Did not initially support.
Age, tenure, educational credentials, race and gender have a higher contribution to promotion and salary growth than does job performance.

#### Get noticed
Higher ups are too busy to keep track of what you're doing.
*Ensure those in higher levels know what you're accomplishing* If you blend in like the foundation of a house, being efficient and effective but not visible, you will go unnoticed.
**Mere Exposure Effect** People prefer what they know to what they don't know. *Being memorable equals getting picked.*

#### Define the dimensions of performance
**Tina Brown Anecdote** Tina, an editor, made a name for herself and the magazines at a high expense - no profit. For her, she defined metric of performance as popularity and acclaim. She made it for herself and for the magazines. She denied a flawed business model, stating the magazines had great content and advertising was growing despite recession.

**Chris, Startup CEO, Anecdote** Chris's SaaS company needed more services to compete. He didn't have the skills to lead that effort. Knowing this, he decreased prices before renewal and told his board that this leads to more customer lock in and increases valuation. The presentation reduced focus on *why* the price drops were necessary. He defined his own metric: customer lock-in. Company sold, he made $4M, and the company eventually languished for being a poor product.

#### Remember what matters to your boss
Ask those in power what aspects of the job they think are the most crucial and how they see what you ought to be doing.

#### Make others feel better about themselves
Don't criticize your boss. If your boss makes a mistake, let someone else point it out.
Flatter those in power because people like it AND because it engages the norm of reciprocity.
**Jack Valenti (aide to LBD) Anecdote** Valenti flattered Johnson by consistently showing him loyalty and agreeing with him.

Most people underestimate the effectiveness of flattery and therefore underutilize it. Most of the time, people believe that it is at once sincere and accurate, leaving them under the influence of the flatterer. There might be a point at which flattery becomes ineffective, but Professor Jennifer Chatman at UC Berkeley couldn't find it in her data.

The people responsible for your success are those above you - with the power to promote or block your rise up the organizational chart. These people are way more influential to your success than your job performance, which may not even be necessary. Your job is to ensure those above you have a strong desire to make you succeed.

#### Chapter Summary
Ensure that those in power:
- Notice the good work you do
- Remember you
- Think well of you because you can make them feel good about themselves

Performance + Political Skill → Helps you rise through the ranks
