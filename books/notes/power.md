# Power: Why Some People Have It—and Others Don't
By Jeffery Pfeffer


## Introduction

### Anecdotes
**Anne Anecdote** Anne made herself scarce (taking classes in engineering school where there's one MBA for every 4 engineers). She showed patience by suggesting a different target market but not forcing it. When the team failed, they saw her value. She did this with presentations and financial projections as well. She had the group appreciate her and realize that she could make a credible threat to quit by letting the group know about her consulting offer. When looking for a CEO, Anne introduced the group to other MBAs, knowing that they're probably most comfortable with her given all the rapport she had built with them. She eventually became co-CEO.

**Beth Anecdote** Beth had a less favorable post-MBA trajectory. She thought the world was fair and she was unwilling to play organizational politics (self-handicapping)

Empirical Research confirms that being politically savvy and seeking power are related to career success and managerial performance.

### Why you should want Power
- Having power and a feeling of control (and thus not feeling stress or out of control) prolongs life expectancy
- Having power increases wealth (Clintons post White House / Rudy after being Mayor both made a ton from speaking and connections)
- Power is necessary to get things done

There are three major obstacles in figuring out a path to power and use what you learn

### Stop thinking the world is a just place
We assume that people that are doing inappropriate, self-aggrandizing, 'pushing the envelope', even if they are successful they will eventually fall.
This has negative effect on the ability to acquire power
- Hinders people's ability to learn from all situation and all people, even those they don't like or respect.
- It makes people not proactive in building a power base

'Just-world hypothesis' comes from people wanting to think the world was predictable and comprehensible → thus controllable. It also holds that people that are fortunate are treated as if they must have done good to earn it. Similarly, if someone is not fortunate, people presume they did something bad.

### Beware of Leadership Literature
Successful leaders gloss over their power plays.
To be successful, people create a positive image of themselves. This makes it seem as if we're in a just world, although it is not reality.
A study shows there were substantial misstatements on more than 40% of resumes.
Follow social science and your own experience. Not Leadership Literature.

### Get out of your own way
**Self-Handicapping** People desire to feel good about themselves and their ability. Failure puts our self-esteem at risk. So if we intentionally choose to do things that might diminish our performance, any subsequent poor results can be explained away as not reflecting our innate abilities.
ie: I didn't get it because I didn't try.
People do this with being political. I didn't rise to the top because I didn't try.

### A guide to using this book

1. Try what you learn
1. Model behavior of effective people you read about.


## Chapter 1: It Takes More Than Performance
As long as you keep your boss happy, performance does not matter that much. If you upset them, performance won't save you.

### The weak link between performance and job outcomes
Supervisors that choose their subordinates rate them more highly than subordinates they inherited.
Confirmation Bias: Chose > Inherited > Did not initially support.
Age, tenure, educational credentials, race and gender have a higher contribution to promotion and salary growth than does job performance.

### Get noticed
Higher ups are too busy to keep track of what you're doing.
*Ensure those in higher levels know what you're accomplishing* If you blend in like the foundation of a house, being efficient and effective but not visible, you will go unnoticed.
**Mere Exposure Effect** People prefer what they know to what they don't know. *Being memorable equals getting picked.*

### Define the dimensions of performance
**Tina Brown Anecdote** Tina, an editor, made a name for herself and the magazines at a high expense - no profit. For her, she defined metric of performance as popularity and acclaim. She made it for herself and for the magazines. She denied a flawed business model, stating the magazines had great content and advertising was growing despite recession.

**Chris, Startup CEO, Anecdote** Chris's SaaS company needed more services to compete. He didn't have the skills to lead that effort. Knowing this, he decreased prices before renewal and told his board that this leads to more customer lock in and increases valuation. The presentation reduced focus on *why* the price drops were necessary. He defined his own metric: customer lock-in. Company sold, he made $4M, and the company eventually languished for being a poor product.

### Remember what matters to your boss
Ask those in power what aspects of the job they think are the most crucial and how they see what you ought to be doing.

### Make others feel better about themselves
Don't criticize your boss. If your boss makes a mistake, let someone else point it out.
Flatter those in power because people like it AND because it engages the norm of reciprocity.
**Jack Valenti (aide to LBD) Anecdote** Valenti flattered Johnson by consistently showing him loyalty and agreeing with him.

Most people underestimate the effectiveness of flattery and therefore underutilize it. Most of the time, people believe that it is at once sincere and accurate, leaving them under the influence of the flatterer. There might be a point at which flattery becomes ineffective, but Professor Jennifer Chatman at UC Berkeley couldn't find it in her data.

The people responsible for your success are those above you - with the power to promote or block your rise up the organizational chart. These people are way more influential to your success than your job performance, which may not even be necessary. Your job is to ensure those above you have a strong desire to make you succeed.

### Chapter Summary
Ensure that those in power:
- Notice the good work you do
- Remember you
- Think well of you because you can make them feel good about themselves

Performance + Political Skill → Helps you rise through the ranks


## Chapter 2: The Personal Qualities That Bring Influence
To be able to obtain and hold onto influence:
1. Believe personal change is always possible
1. See your strengths and weaknesses as objectively as possible
1. Understand qualities for building a power base so we can focus our time and attention on building them

### Change is always possible
It might be easier to learn skills as a kid, but it's never too late. You can cultivate the personal attributes that create influence at any age.
*John (GSB Student) Anecdote* John projected confidence and self-assurance during interviews. Scored 7 offers. A number of those offering jobs said he stood out from his peers through his behavior.


### Do an objective self-assessment
Realize your strengths and weaknesses to develop the behaviors to create influence.
It's hard to be self-critical on the past. Instead, we can focus on what we *need to do* to get ready for subsequent positions and career challenges we will confront.

We don't know what we're not skilled at. We should ask those who are more skilled for honest advice on what our holes are.
This requires admitting that we have holes and that we are ignorant to what these holes are. That's not easy.
People that admit to being ignorant to holes and ask for advice on how to fill them are the ones that are more likely to improve on gaining influence.


### Seven important personal qualities that build power
Two fundamental dimensions that distinguish people who rise to great heights and accomplish amazing things
- Will
  - Ambition
  - Energy
  - Focus
- Skill
  - Self-Knowledge (Reflective Mindset)
  - Confidence (Ability to project self-assurance)
  - Empathy with others
  - Capacity to tolerate conflict

#### Ambition
An unwavering focus to achieve goals. Not getting hung up on the imperfect.

#### Energy
1. Energy is contagious. It inspires more effort on the part of others. People are more willing to expend effort if you are too.
1. Energy makes people go longer (excitement + less sleep). This is an advantage in getting things accomplished. Many studies show that exceptional accomplishment requires laborious preparation (many many many hours)
1. People often promote those with energy because it signals commitment and loyalty.

We can practice developing energy. Internship / Residency does this for doctors, for example. Working out mid-day might do it for some people.

#### Focus
There are several dimensions to focus.

- Specialization in an industry or company. This leads to more deep knowledge of the space and also more connections.
- Concentration on a limited set of activities or functional skills. If genius requires large number of hours, you can acquire those hours in less elapsed time by focusing your attention more narrowly.
- Concentrate on those activities that are most critical within your particular job or position. These activities are the ones that have the most impact on getting work done and on others perceptions of you and your effectiveness. Focus on the 5-10% of possible duties that have the most leverage to manage time effectively.

#### Self-Knowledge
*Joe Beneducci Anecdote* Attained a high level at a young age through extensive reading and structured self-reflection.
*Dr Maidique Anecdote*  Leadership habits that made him effective: Making notes about decisions, meetings and other intreactions and reflecting on what he had done well or poorly so he could improve his skills

There's no learning and personal development without reflection. Structured reflection takes time. It requires the **discipline** to concentrate, makes notes, and think about what you are doing.

#### Confidence
Because power is likely to cause people to behave in a more confident fashion, observers will associate confident behavior with actually having power. Coming accorss as confident and knowledgable helps you build influence.
*Amanda Anecdote* Amanda went to management school. Coming out she was drafting an email to her company sponsors. A friend strengthened the tone, making it clear Amanda aspired to the senior executive ranks and was looking for a career that would get here there. Her company liked her confident approach and expressions of ambitious career aspirations. That's how career executives behave and Amanda was just like them ✅.

#### Empathy with others
What sometimes gets in the way of putting ourselves in the shoes of others is too much focus on the end goal and our own objectives and not enough concern for recruiting others to our side. Think about *Laura Esserman UCSF Breast Cancer Center Anecdote*.
Putting yourself in the other's place is one of the best ways to advance your own goals.

#### Capacity to tolerate conflict
Workplace bullying persists because it's extremely effective for the perpetrator. This is because most people are conflict-averse and avoid difficult situations.
*If you can handle difficult conflict and stress-filled situations, you have an advantage over most people*
Being mean and tough is a power play.

### Intelligence
Intelligence helps in building reputation and in job performance but often holds the seesds of people's downfall because of overconfidence and insensitivity.

Intelligence can make acquiring and holding onto influence less likely.
Exceptionally smart people
- think they can do everything on their own and fail to bring allies that could be helpful along with them.
- can be overconfident and arrogant
- can be intimidating


## Chapter 3: Choosing Where to Start
Where you build your career matters. Where you start affects your salary growth.
Common mistake: Join department dealing with the org's current core activity -> There's already a lot of talented competition there. Their career paths there are already established.

### Unexpected Paths to Power
*Yusuf at SAP Anecdote* Lucky and serendipitous, but with intention.

*Whiz Kids at Ford Anecdote* Strategic to join Ford
Whiz Kids had the following:
1. Advanced degrees + elite credentials
1. Analytical orientation -> Appearance of rationality for a troubled company
1. Could talk like Wall Street -> Important when Ford was going public
1. Centrality in Consequential Decisions -> Finance moved talented people into other areas of co. to extend influence. It controlled agendas and flow of information. They determined performance evaluation process at company.

### What makes some departments more powerful than others
- Common bonds of communication with trust that come through shared experiences.
- Critical resources (money + skills)
As demands change, so does the locus of power in a company.
When *Yusuf* came to SAP, designing software wasn't the problem that needed solving. There were already brilliant engineers.
SAP or competitior already had the Large Enterprise market covered. Needed to expand. *Central Strategic Focus and Marketing Approach* was the Need. That's what Yusuf covered by heading CCT.
When *Whiz Kids* came to Ford, design + engineering weren't critical (there were barely any cars on the road so people bought whatever was built).
Analytical skills and high education were the most important at Ford at the time.
