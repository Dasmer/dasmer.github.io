# Power: Why Some People Have Itâ€”and Others Don't
By Jeffery Pfeffer

## Notes

### Introduction

#### Anecdotes
*Anne Anecdote* Anne made herself scarce (taking classes in engineering school where there's one MBA for every 4 engineers). She showed patience by suggesting a different target market but not forcing it. When the team failed, they saw her value. She did this with presentations and financial projections as well. She had the group appreciate her and realize that she could make a credible threat to quit by letting the group know about her consulting offer. When looking for a CEO, Anne introduced the group to other MBAs, knowing that they're probably most comfortable with her given all the rapport she had built with them. She eventually became co-CEO.
*Beth Anecdote* Beth had a less favorable post-MBA trajectory. She thought the world was fair and she was unwilling to play organizational politics (self-handicapping)

Empirical Research confirms that being politically savvy and seeking power are related to career success and managerial performance.

#### Why you should want Power
- Having power and a feeling of control (and thus not feeling stress or out of control) prolongs life expectancy
- Having power increases wealth (Clintons post White House / Rudy after being Mayor both made a ton from speaking and connections)
