# Power: Why Some People Have It—and Others Don't
By Jeffery Pfeffer

## Notes

### Introduction

#### Anecdotes
**Anne Anecdote** Anne made herself scarce (taking classes in engineering school where there's one MBA for every 4 engineers). She showed patience by suggesting a different target market but not forcing it. When the team failed, they saw her value. She did this with presentations and financial projections as well. She had the group appreciate her and realize that she could make a credible threat to quit by letting the group know about her consulting offer. When looking for a CEO, Anne introduced the group to other MBAs, knowing that they're probably most comfortable with her given all the rapport she had built with them. She eventually became co-CEO.
**Beth Anecdote** Beth had a less favorable post-MBA trajectory. She thought the world was fair and she was unwilling to play organizational politics (self-handicapping)

Empirical Research confirms that being politically savvy and seeking power are related to career success and managerial performance.

#### Why you should want Power
- Having power and a feeling of control (and thus not feeling stress or out of control) prolongs life expectancy
- Having power increases wealth (Clintons post White House / Rudy after being Mayor both made a ton from speaking and connections)
- Power is necessary to get things done

There are three major obstacles in figuring out a path to power and use what you learn

#### Stop thinking the world is a just place
We assume that people that are doing inappropriate, self-aggrandizing, 'pushing the envelope', even if they are successful they will eventually fall.
This has negative effect on the ability to acquire power
- Hinders people's ability to learn from all situation and all people, even those they don't like or respect.
- It makes people not proactive in building a power base

'Just-world hypothesis' comes from people wanting to think the world was predictable and comprehensible → thus controllable. It also holds that people that are fortunate are treated as if they must have done good to earn it. Similarly, if someone is not fortunate, people presume they did something bad.

#### Beware of Leadership Literature
Successful leaders gloss over their power plays.
To be successful, people create a positive image of themselves. This makes it seem as if we're in a just world, although it is not reality.
A study shows there were substantial misstatements on more than 40% of resumes.
Follow social science and your own experience. Not Leadership Literature.

#### Get out of your own way
**Self-Handicapping** People desire to feel good about themselves and their ability. Failure puts our self-esteem at risk. So if we intentionally choose to do things that might diminish our performance, any subsequent poor results can be explained away as not reflecting our innate abilities.
ie: I didn't get it because I didn't try.
People do this with being political. I didn't rise to the top because I didn't try.
